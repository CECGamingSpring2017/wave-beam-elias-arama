Picture 1 : 
I made the frequency very high, and flipped the multiplication signs to division signs, so the waves would be flipped
Picture 2:
I made the amplitude equal to 0, which makes no waves, just a straight line
Picture 3:
Made a vertical shift and it made the waves come out of the ship at the bottom.
Picture 4:
I made the first wave's amplitude much higher, and made the new one have a small amplitude. While the green one's amplitude is bigger,
the frequency is the same.
