Original Equation: y = a sin(x-h)+k
Picture 1 : 
The whole beam just went crazy. This happened because i changed the sine to tangent.
Picture 2:
The amplitude of the waves got bigger because i changed the first number to a higher number.
Picture 3:
Made a vertical shift and it made the waves come out of the ship at the bottom. The "+ k" at the end of the equation is what changes this. Changing it to a higher number makes the beam move down.
Picture 4:
